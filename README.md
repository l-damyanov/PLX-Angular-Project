# PLX-Angular-Project
This is my project for the Angular course in SoftUni. It is about submitting offers and searching for private lesson offers as well.

# About the project
* The project is using back4app as an API
* It is written in Angular
* It follows all requirements for the project defence

# Project usability
* The project includes a read-only part for unauthenticated users
* Authanticated users have full access to all CRUD operations ONLY for offers created by them
* Authanticated users can write comments to all offers created by users but cannot edit or delete them (i hope to implement edit/delete in the future)
